    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm an MIT undergraduate student studying mathematics and computer science. I'm taking some time off from school to work in Palo Alto, and I'm looking to tutor students in the area. I've participated in many different high school math and programming contests, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AMC 12</li>
      <li>AIME</li>
      <li>USAMO</li>
      <li>USACO Platinum division</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    My personal academic passions are algorithms, machine learning, and statistics, but my experience extends far beyond that. You can browse the <a href="subjects.html">subjects</a> I teach, and see my <a href="Alok-tutoring-resume.pdf">resume</a>.
